1. If I were to design an audio aura based on this top 100 songs list (with an average valence of 0.484443, energy of 0.65906, and danceability of 0.71646), I would say that this person is someone who always lifts the mood wherever they go with their music, which is all made for dancing.
2. To improve this subjective method, I would not only use the average of valence, energy, and danceability, but also include speechiness to see if the person identifies with the songs, and tempo to enrich the energy data. These would be implemented in the audio aura formula by emphasizing the highest values. It would also be great to check if the values vary a lot. This could mean multiple listeners or musical tastes.
